## 🧠 AI Customer Service Chatbot ( Intent Classification + Flask Web App)

### 🎯 Major Goal
Build an **end-to-end AI-powered chatbot** that can automatically understand customer queries (intents) such as: Cancel Order, Track Refund, Payment Issue etc, and respond intelligently using a trained **NLP + ML model**.

---
### 🧩 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how AI can assist customer support by:

- 🧠 Understanding user messages using NLP  
- 🤖 Predicting intent using a trained **Logistic Regression** model  
- 💬 Linking each intent to a predefined response (mini chatbot)  
- 🧾 Handling multi-step queries with **slot filling** (e.g., asking for order ID)  
- 🌐 Providing a live **Flask web interface** for interaction

### ⚙️ How It Works

#### 1️⃣ User Enters Message
Example:  
> “I want to cancel my order”

#### 2️⃣ Text Preprocessing & Vectorization
User text is cleaned and converted into a **TF-IDF vector**.

#### 3️⃣ Intent Classification
The trained model predicts:  
> `cancel_order`

#### 4️⃣ Response Mapping
The chatbot retrieves the corresponding response from `intents_responses.json`.

#### 5️⃣ Conversation Flow
If the intent requires extra info (e.g., order ID), the bot dynamically asks for it handled via **slot extraction** and **simulated backend**.
